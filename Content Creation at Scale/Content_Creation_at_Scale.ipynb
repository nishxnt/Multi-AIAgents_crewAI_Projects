            "Since our last forecast was published in March, we have continued to see a relatively rapid change in economic policies. We recognize that the policy environment remains very fluid, so none of our scenario forecasts are meant to be a precise estimate of where the US economy ends up in the future. Instead, we have developed three scenarios to provide a guide as to where the economy might go from here based on explicit assumptions. Our baseline forecast incorporates assumptions that reflect our best guess of how different economic policies will evolve. Our downside and upside scenarios reflect plausible outcomes for the US economy should our assumptions prove to be overly optimistic or pessimistic, respectively.1\n",
            "The main differences across our scenarios involve assumptions around tariff policy, monetary policy, inflation, and treasury yields. Tariff policy has been particularly difficult to nail down as trade negotiations are ongoing and many of the tariffs are being adjudicated in the courts.2 However, we assume that tariffs are at least modestly higher than they were at the start of this year across all three scenarios. Monetary policy, inflation, and treasury yields are clearly interrelated, but we make different assumptions based on how those variables correlate with one another. After all, there are times when these variables move in different directions, while other times they move in tandem.\n",

            "Scenarios\n",
            "Baseline:\n",
            "Our baseline forecast is closest to how we expect the economy will grow based on a set of assumptions made at the time of analysis. Despite recent court rulings, we expect that the average tariff rate remains around 15% throughout the forecast period, though the country- and product-specific rates are expected to change. For example, we expect the average tariff rate on imports from Canada and Mexico to steadily fall to about 3% by next year. This happens because exporters in those countries will increasingly be able to comply with requirements of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (UMSCA),3 bringing the average tariff rate down over time. In addition, we anticipate a 50% average tariff on China, which is about where they were as of May 14, 20% on the European Union, and 10% on most other countries.\n",
            "We also assume that the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that are set to expire at the end of this year are ultimately extended, preventing a tax increase in 2026, and that additional tax cuts are also included in the final budget bill. Although the overall bill is expansionary relative to what would happen if the provisions were allowed to expire, it offers only limited upside next year relative to the government’s tax and fiscal stance this year. Part of this is due to the assumption that there is a more modest increase in the deficit as a result of the final legislation relative to what the US House of Representatives passed initially.\n",
            "Longer-term interest rates have increased recently, as bond investors demand higher yields to lend to the US government. We expect the 10-year treasury yield to hover near 4.5% for the remainder of this year, despite a softening in economic data and a 50-basis-point cut from the Fed in the fourth quarter of 2025. The 10-year treasury yield begins to decline slowly in 2026, falling to 4.1% by 2027 and remaining there through the end of 2029. The Fed’s hesitance to cut rates quickly is due to the inflationary impulse of tariffs, which bring the core PCE price deflator up to 3.6% on a year-over-year basis by the fourth quarter of 2025. The inflationary impulse proves to be temporary, allowing the Fed to cut rates slowly throughout 2026, bringing the federal funds rate to a range between 3% and 3.25% by the first quarter of 2027.\n",
            "In this scenario, the higher tariff costs coupled with elevated interest rates cause businesses to slow their pace of investment and hiring throughout the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. This may lead to the unemployment rate to rise to 4.6% in 2026. Elevated trade barriers on US imports as well as exports slow the pace of international trade, with real imports of goods and services falling by 7.1% in 2026, and real exports falling 1.8%. As a result, real GDP growth is expected to be 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. Real GDP accelerates in 2027 and 2028 before settling into its steady-state growth rate of about 1.8% in 2029.\n",
            "Trade tensions ease (upside):\n",
            "Our upside scenario assumes that more trade agreements are finalized, allowing the average tariff rate to move substantially lower. The average tariff rate falls to about 7.5% by the end of 2025. Imports from Canada and Mexico quickly become compliant with the USMCA, rapidly reducing the effective tariff rate from both countries even ahead of the updated USMCA agreement we expect to be reached in 2026. The average tariff on China comes down to about 30%, while the European Union faces a tariff of just 5%.\n",
            "Despite much lower tariffs, the US economy is still expected to grow at a slower rate in 2025 compared with the previous two years. In particular, consumer spending had been growing at a much faster rate than income, suggesting that consumption would slow this year. However, lower tariffs allow for inflation to fall more quickly, which gives consumers additional purchasing power.\n",
            "As inflation subsides, the Fed is able take a more dovish approach to monetary policy. We assume the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points in each quarter starting with the third quarter of 2025 and ending with the fourth quarter of 2026. The final budget bill extends current tax provisions but is projected to add significantly less to the federal deficit than previously expected. This prevents a rise in taxes while also calming bond markets. The yield on the 10-year treasury is expected to fall to 4.25% by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n",
            "More trade deals and lower tariffs unleash business investment, which had been subdued due to economic policy uncertainty. Lower interest rates and inflation also help to support business investment. Additionally, we assume that deregulation and gains from artificial intelligence improve, leading to a rise in productivity growth over the forecast period.\n",
            "Trade deals fall apart (downside):\n",
            "Our downside scenario includes a bigger rise in tariffs in the United States and abroad relative to our baseline. We assume that the average tariff rate rises to about 25% as negotiations for new trade agreements stall and existing agreements fall apart. Notably, the tariff rate on imports from China rises to 75%, while imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union all face 25% tariffs. The rest of the world generally faces 10% tariffs. We also assume that the bond market reacts to the higher tariffs and the passage of the budget bill, sending the yield on the 10-year treasury above 5% in the fourth quarter of 2025. This forces the US government into an austerity trap where cuts to spending and higher tax rates are required to bring the interest rate on government bonds back down.\n",
            "As a result of the bond market turmoil and austere fiscal policy, the US enters a recession in the fourth quarter of 2025 and does not return to its prerecession level of real GDP until early 2027. All sectors of the economy face sizable declines in 2026. Real GDP falls 1.7% with consumer spending, government spending, business investment, imports, and exports all declining on a year-over-year basis. The 10-year treasury yield falls gradually, remaining above 4.5% until the end of 2026.\n",
            "Given the bond market reaction to fiscal policy, real federal spending declines in 2026 and 2027, creating a substantial drag on economic growth. Federal spending remains weak in 2028 and 2029 as policymakers are hesitant to introduce stronger spending out of fear that the bond market will react negatively. With the public and private sectors shedding jobs, the unemployment rate rises to 6% in the middle of 2026 and remains at 4.5% in 2028.\n",
            "With both inflation and the unemployment rate rising quickly, the Fed is stuck choosing between its inflation and full employment mandates. As a result, it remains on hold until the fourth quarter of 2025. It initially cuts by just 50 basis points in the fourth quarter as inflation continues to accelerate. However, once there is turmoil in bond markets and there is evidence that inflation may be turning the corner, the Fed cuts rates more aggressively. In the first quarter of 2026, it cuts rates by 100 basis points, followed by further 50-basis-point cuts in each of the next three quarters. Only in 2027 is the Fed able to slowly raise rates back toward neutral.\n",

            "Consumer spending\n",
            "Real consumer spending has slowed. For the first quarter of 2025, overall real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 1.2% at annual rates, well below the 4% growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. Spending on durable goods decelerated the most, falling by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 after rising more than 12% in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "Despite looming tariff hikes, consumer spending did not spike higher in the first quarter to avoid rising costs. Instead, it seems that falling consumer sentiment led to a pullback in spending at the start of the year. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment, a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels in the United States, fell 18.2% between December 2024 and June 2025.4 At the same time, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 3.3% in January to 5.1% in June. However, after a temporary pause of some of the tariffs on China, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index increased by more than 12 points in the month to May to 98.0, which is modestly higher than the level in June 2024.5\n",
            "Consumer spending is expected to remain subdued going into 2026. Aggregate wages have been growing on a year-over-year basis more slowly than aggregate spending since July 2024. This is expected to restrain consumer spending in the near term. Although we expect the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025, longer-term interest rates are expected to remain higher, limiting the transmission of looser monetary policy. In addition, increased delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans suggest that some consumer segments will struggle to be able to use debt to increase spending.\n",
            "Overall, we forecast real consumer spending will rise 1.4% this year before growing at a slightly faster 1.5% pace in 2026. Higher tariffs and elevated interest rates both negatively affect durable goods spending growth, which is expected to slow down by 0.7% in 2025 and shrink by 0.2% in 2026. Spending on nondurables is expected to rise by 1.4% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026. Finally, spending on services is expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and in 2026 as services will be less impacted by tariffs and interest rates.\n",

            "Housing\n",
            "Long-term interest rates have been rising, with the 30-year treasury yield rising above 5% at the end of May. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has been slightly more subdued but remains just shy of 7% as of this writing. Elevated rates have restrained residential investment, and housing starts were 4.7% lower in May compared with a year earlier. Similarly, building permits were down 6.4% over the same period. Housing starts never returned to their peak levels from before the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009. The long-term failure to build enough homes has contributed to the lack of inventory and elevated prices we see today in some parts of the country. We may have to wait for rates to drop to see a significant uptick in housing construction.\n",
            "We expect housing starts to continue falling through the first half of 2026, before rising again in the latter half of the year. Overall, we expect housing starts to fall to 1.29 million in 2025 and to 1.27 million in 2026. Thereafter, we anticipate housing starts to rise for the remainder of the forecast period once the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowers rates once again. After 2026, we expect the housing stock to rise more rapidly than total population, helped in part by the slower population growth.\n",

            "Investment is spending that helps grow the long-term productive capacity of the economy, and as such, is one of the most important indicators of an economy’s future potential. Investment often follows a cyclical pattern, driven by commodity price booms and economic cycles. It can also be incentivized by policies like lower taxes or subsidies for investments.\n",
            "Business confidence is a crucial determinant of the level of investment growth, as businesses need to feel positive about their future potential to justify spending money to grow their operations. Unfortunately, business confidence is weakening in the face of uncertainty. The National Federation of Independent Business’ small business optimism index had been falling since December 2024, though it recovered slightly in May.6 Plans to make capital expenditures had fallen to the lowest since 2020 in April and remained weak in May. In addition, several regional Federal Reserve Bank surveys7 indicate a relatively weak outlook for business conditions.8\n",
            "Interest rates also influence investment. Corporate borrowing rates increased along with inflation into 2023. Since then, rates have come down slightly but remain high relative to pre-pandemic levels, particularly for longer-term borrowing. However, many firms still have more cash on hand than they did before the pandemic, and they can consequently avoid borrowing at elevated rates.\n",
            "After posting a 1.5% decline in the first quarter of 2025, we predict investment in structures will continue to fall into the first quarter of 2026. Overall, we predict investment in structures to fall 1.6% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026. The decline in structures investment in 2026 obscures a rebound that occurs in the second quarter of 2026.\n",
            "Besides structures construction, other types of business investment include spending on machinery and equipment (M&E), such as on computers or industrial equipment, and on intellectual property, such as software or AI. Businesses accelerated their purchases of equipment in the first quarter of 2025 to avoid tariffs. Real spending on equipment grew by 24.7% (at annual rates) in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the previous quarter. We expect growth to drop substantially as tariff costs begin to bite. Investment in intellectual property products is expected to remain stronger as it is far less exposed to tariffs. Our forecast shows M&E investments rising just 0.1% in 2025 and declining 2.5% in 2026. We see intellectual property spending rising 2.4% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026.\n",
            "The resumption of bonus depreciation that has been gradually phased out under the TCJA is expected to support investment spending beginning next year. However, higher tariffs and interest rates restrain growth in the near term. Overall, in 2025, we predict business investment to rise just 0.7%, slowing from the 3.7% recorded in 2024. As interest rates come down and policy uncertainty wanes, business investment will grow 1.1% in 2026 and 4.6% in 2027.\n",

            "Foreign trade remains the sector with the biggest question marks surrounding it. Tariff details are being changed frequently. Two federal courts ruled against President Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on trading partners. On May 28, the Court of International Trade invalidated the tariffs on a nationwide basis, while a separate court invalidated the application of tariffs more narrowly on the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Both rulings have been temporarily stayed and the cases are in the process of appeal,9 which has made the future path of tariffs and trade policy even more uncertain. Further, the rulings do not apply to tariffs imposed under other statutes.\n",
            "In our baseline scenario, we raise the average tariff rate on goods imports by 12 percentage points, from approximately 2.5% to 14.5%. This level is equivalent to having a 50% tariff on China, 20% on the European Union, 3% on Mexico and Canada, and 10% on the rest of the world. However, we assume that the average effective tariff rate on Canada and Mexico declines steadily to 3% as more goods from those countries are deemed USMCA compliant. Readers can also refer to our downside scenario, which contains a 22-percentage-point increase in the average tariff rate, for an indication of what might happen if tariffs rise even higher. That downside scenario would be roughly equivalent to a 75% tariff on China, a 25% tariff on the European Union, Mexico, and Canada, and 10% tariffs on the rest of the world.\n",
            "The imposition of these tariffs is likely to turn into a complicated process involving individuals and businesses trying to make substitution and supply chain decisions based on new relative prices. As elevated tariffs remain in place, we expect growth in exports and imports to rise by 0.4% and 2.9% in 2025, respectively. Import growth this year is flattered by a surge in imports at the start of the year as importers sought to avoid looming tariffs. Trade growth slows more dramatically by the end of 2025. In 2026, exports will fall by 1.8%, while imports plummet by 7.1%.\n",
            "It may be surprising to see that exports may suffer by the imposition of tariffs. There are a few reasons why this may be the case in the short term, and why these tariffs may not have their desired impact in the long run. First, about half of imports are currently used as intermediate inputs by US businesses. It is likely to take some time for US producers to find local alternatives to the goods they are currently importing, and in the meantime, their cost of doing business will rise. This dynamic could reduce the money available to firms to invest and may drive some US producers out of business if the costs are not passed on to consumers. It may also make their exports costlier and less competitive. Tariffs may shield US producers from the import competition required to make globally competitive products. So, while they may dominate the US economy, they are also likely to lose export sales, which could potentially lead to limited net gain for American manufacturing.\n",
            "There are potential benefits of tariffs, though they would take much longer than four years to be realized, and so do not occur within our forecast horizon. In most industries, there is not a large pool of American manufacturing production currently staffed up but sitting idle. Factories will need to be built, and workers hired and trained, both of which will take time. During this transition period, when there are no US alternative goods, the cost of tariffs is likely to be borne by American households and businesses. In many cases, the reason for offshoring can have as much to do with the availability of certain skills as it does cost, and reshoring all this production will require major skills-training programs to ensure an adequate supply of workers.\n",

            "As of this writing, the House of Representatives passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes changes to federal tax and spending priorities. We recognize that the final legislation may look different from this bill but use it as a guide for our baseline forecast. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that the bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, would add about $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years excluding debt service and macroeconomic effects.10 Most of that rise in the deficit will occur earlier in CBO’s 10-year forecast window. For example, just over $1 trillion would be added to the deficit in 2026 and 2027 alone.\n",
            "Some of the largest tax cuts in the bill include an extension of the tax provisions in the TCJA that were set to expire, an elimination of taxes on overtime and tipped income, and an increase of the cap on deductible state and local income tax. To offset these tax reductions in the budget window, savings are found by repealing and modifying tax credits that were previously part of the Inflation Reduction Act and cutting expenditures on Medicaid and food assistance.11\n",
            "Although the increase to the deficit is expected to be substantial, the economic effects are more limited. Much of the cost of the budget bill is spent extending tax provisions that are already in place. Extending those provisions creates neither a stimulative nor contractionary effect. After removing those provisions, we find that the direct effect of the bill would raise economic growth by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point in 2026 and then subtract a roughly equivalent amount by 2029. In addition, we assume that the final legislation adds slightly less to the deficit and is therefore slightly less stimulative than the bill that the House of Representatives initially passed.\n",
            "In addition to the budget bill, trade policy will also generate revenues. Using our baseline assumptions for tariffs, we estimate that tariffs would create about $2.5 trillion over the next decade. On the spending side, federal government employment has been declining since January 2025, a trend we expect to continue through the end of 2028.\n",
            "Incorporating all these factors plus debt service costs and economic effects, we find that the federal budget deficit will rise to 6.4% of GDP in 2025 from 6.2% in 2024. The deficit will rise slightly to 6.5% in 2026 before narrowing for the rest of the forecast.\n",

            "At the time of writing, labor markets continue to look relatively healthy. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% in May, the same rate as April and March, while the average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were 124,000 during the first five months of this year, lower than the average gain of 168,000 observed in 2024.\n",
            "Although the labor market has held up so far this year, there are a few very early signs that cracks are emerging. For one, the number of people claiming unemployment insurance has started to rise, though it remains low by historical levels. Employment in the federal government has also been declining since the start of this year. Job cut announcements have grown this year. Much of the increase has been in the public sector, but even after excluding those workers, job cut announcements were still elevated compared with a year earlier.\n",
            "In the long term, demographics are the most important determinant for labor markets. A surge in immigration over the last three years has caused stronger than anticipated labor force growth. Given the current administration’s more hawkish immigration policy stance and the sharp drop in reported border crossings,12 we expect the labor force will grow slightly slower than what had been expected prior to these developments. However, the total effect on immigration remains highly uncertain. We therefore made only modest changes to demographics for the next four quarters. We will likely need to adjust this part of the forecast in the future as more data becomes available.\n",
            "We expect job growth to slow this year as economic growth weakens due to tariffs and elevated interest rates. The sharpest drop in employment growth is likely to be in federal government, but employment growth in the private sector is also expected to moderate into next year. We expect the unemployment rate to rise from 4.2% to an average of 4.6% in 2026 before declining toward 4.1% in 2029.\n",

            "Stock markets have shown considerable volatility this year as they react to rapid changes in economic policy. Equity prices plummeted when “reciprocal tariffs” were announced on April 2. The announced country-specific tariff rates were evidently much higher than investors had anticipated. Once the 90-day pause in those higher reciprocal tariffs was announced, stock prices rebounded. As of this writing, the S&P 500 stock price index has yet to return to the high reached in February.\n",
            "While equity markets plunged and mostly recovered in April, bond markets have been acting unusually. During financial market stress, the yield on US treasury bonds increased and the value of the dollar fell. In the past, the exact opposite usually occurs during times of financial stress. Since then, yields on longer-term treasury bonds have remained elevated and the dollar has remained weak. In addition, the dollar had been expected to appreciate as tariffs were implemented, making the recent downturn in the dollar particularly unusual.\n",
            "In our baseline forecast, we maintain a relatively high 10-year treasury yield. However, we assume it remains around 4.5% through the end of this year, roughly where it was in May on average. In our downside scenario, we explore what would happen if bond yields jumped significantly higher should bond investors become uneasy about the sustainability of US government debt.\n",
            "Since the FOMC began its rate-cutting cycle, it cut rates worth 100 basis points, bringing the Fed’s target range to between 4.25% and 4.5%. However, policymakers are now entering a period of harder choices on interest rates.\n",
            "In our baseline scenario, we think the Fed remains on hold until the fourth quarter of this year. Stubborn inflation, elevated inflation expectations, and the threat of an inflationary impulse from tariffs will slow the speed at which interest rates can be brought back down. We now expect the federal funds rate to settle at 3.125% by the fourth quarter of 2026. In all scenarios, we expect that the FOMC will maintain its independence, with its mandate remaining unchanged.\n",

            "Headline inflation has come down modestly, with year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation in May coming down to 2.4%, tied for the second-lowest reading since February 2021. Similarly, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—the personal consumption expenditures deflator—came in at 2.1% year over year in May, just slightly above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has been more persistent. For example, core CPI inflation was 2.8% in May. Still, the Fed is seeing steady, if modest, progress on its inflation mandate.\n",
            "While the inflationary environment has improved a bit, the outlook remains more worrying. So far, there has been little evidence of tariffs in the consumer inflation data. However, we expect inflation to pick up a little this year. With an acceleration in prices due to tariffs, we expect CPI growth to average 2.9% in 2025 and accelerate  to 3.2% in 2026. Thereafter, inflation is expected to moderate to about 2.3% in 2029.\n",
            "In addition to the inflationary impulse from tariffs, we expect inflation expectations to drive some of this acceleration. In May, the New York Fed’s survey of consumer expectations revealed a one-year ahead median point prediction for inflation to be 4.3%.13 That was up from just 3% in November 2024. Other measures have shown more extreme increases in inflation expectations. For example, in the University of Michigan’s June survey, forward inflation expectations rose to 5.1% from 3.3% in January. Because inflation expectations tend to influence actual inflation, the Fed’s role involves controlling not only real prices but also market expectations. These data points, as well as the potential inflationary effects of tariffs, will give the FOMC a pause when considering if further interest rate cuts are appropriate.\n",

            "With the latest updates on US inflation and the impact on the stock market in 2024, the information gathered from the search and reading tasks provides a comprehensive overview of the current economic situation. The US economic forecast Q2 2025 by Deloitte Insights offers an in-depth analysis of the economy, including consumer spending, housing, business investment, foreign trade, government policy, labor market, financial markets, and prices. The forecast also presents three scenarios: baseline, upside, and downside. The baseline scenario assumes that tariffs will remain around 15% throughout the forecast period, with some fluctuations. The upside scenario assumes that more trade agreements will be finalized, leading to lower tariffs, while the downside scenario assumes that tariffs will rise to around 25%. The forecast predicts that the US economy will grow at a slower rate in 2025 and 2026, with real GDP growth expected to be 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.\u001b[00m\n",

            "June’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation moving higher.\n",
            "Investors don’t yet show significant signs of concern.\n",
            "However, markets are watching for signs that implemented and proposed higher tariffs push inflation higher.\n",
            "For the first time since January 2025, headline inflation is accelerating again. The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report shows that prices increased by 2.7% over the past 12 months, compared to 2.4% for the year ending in May. 1\n",
            "Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2025.\n",
            "President Donald Trump strongly supports higher tariffs on imported goods and is actively pursuing such policies, which may impact inflation. “Investors are watching inflation closely because of the uncertainty related to tariffs,” says Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. Inflation was higher in June for some goods categories more often imported like appliances and apparel.\n",
            "Core inflation also rises\n",
            "Volatile food and energy prices can greatly impact the headline CPI (as shown above). Market watchers often focus more on the direction of core inflation measures, which exclude those volatile food and energy costs. In June, the 12-month core CPI rose slightly to 2.9% (from 2.8% in May), reversing a four-month flat or declining trend. 1\n",
            "Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2025.\n",
            "Of note, shelter costs are 3.8% higher year-over-year, making it a significant inflation contributor. 1 Shelter costs are one of the main contributors to June’s inflation and account for more than one-third of the CPI, though the rate of increase is slowing over the past year. 2 Food prices also increased.\n",
            "A second key inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to 2.3% in May 2025, up from 2.2% a month earlier. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) increased to 2.7% through May. 3 The two indices, CPI and PCE, both attempt to measure the prices consumers pay for goods and services but vary slightly in formula, weighting, and inclusion methodologies with the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculating CPI and the Bureau of Economic Analysis the PCE price index. 4\n",
            "The Trump tariff question\n",
            "Since peaking at more than 9% annually in June 2022, inflation has trended lower, with some fluctuations since September 2024. 2 However, President Trump’s announced and implemented tariff plans raise concerns that inflation could rise again. The Federal Reserve's (Fed's) Federal Open Market Committee projections, released in June, forecast core PCE inflation reaching 3.1% by year’s end. 5\n",
            "“What investors are wondering now is whether there’s a level or duration of tariffs that leads to higher prices. Is there a point where businesses run out of ways to avoid passing on the higher tariff costs to consumers?”\n",
            "- Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\n",
            "Tariff policies seem to be central to the Fed’s inflation assessment. At the start of the year, U.S. tariff revenue was 2.5%, as of May 2025 it exceeded 8%. President Trump is proposing tariffs between 25% and 40% on goods imported from many key trading partners. “Investors are assessing what tariff rate or duration of tariff policy ultimately leads to higher prices,” says Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “What is the threshold when businesses can no longer avoid passing on higher tariff costs to consumers?”\n",
            "Over 2025’s second half, one of the overriding market questions is how much inflation is affected by higher tariffs. “Our proprietary model suggests higher prices are likely to continue creeping into inflation data,” says Merz. The Fed also reports that all 12 regional districts within its jurisdiction show increasing inflationary pressures related to tariffs. 6\n",
            "The nation’s effective tariff rate using a blend of May and June data rose to 10%, much higher than the 2-3% range of recent years. Some projections suggest that if the Trump administration proceeds with current tariff proposals, that rate could reach 20%. 7\n",
            "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; June 30, 2015 – June 30, 2025. Effective tariff rate = U.S. customs revenue divided by total U.S. goods imports.\n",
            "The Fed’s response\n",
            "Markets are especially interested in when the Fed will start cutting interest rates again. After raising rates rapidly in 2022 and 2023 to fight inflation, the Fed in late 2024 cut rates by one percent. This year, inflation hasn't improved, and President Trump’s tariff policies have added to uncertainty about inflation’s future. So far, the Fed is keeping interest rates steady this year.\n",
            "President Trump remains outspoken in his criticism of the Fed’s rate-cutting reluctance. Yet Fed Chair Jerome Powell says that potential inflation from tariffs limits the Fed’s ability to lower rates. The Fed currently expects two rate cuts this year, generally aligned with market expectations.\n",

            "Market concerns beyond inflation\n",
            "“Markets could be sensitive to sustained, accelerating inflation,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. However, Haworth warns that inflation is not the only key measure that could trigger market volatility. “If the labor market weakens,” says Haworth, “that could be a sign of an economic slowdown, and markets would take that seriously as well.”\n",
            "Merz agrees that markets focus on various data points. “Ultimately, it comes down to what the consumer is doing,” says Merz.\n",
            "In an environment characterized by rapidly evolving changes, including the possible effects of inflation from increased tariffs, investors benefit from keeping a broadly diversified portfolio.\n",
            "“We continue to emphasize multiple return and income sources within client portfolios, and having a global perspective and the flexibility to embrace a variety of asset classes will likely benefit investors,” notes Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group.\n",
            "It’s important to remember that a consistent long-term strategy tends to work to the benefit of most investors. This likely precludes any dramatic changes to your asset allocation strategy in response to today’s capital market environment.\n",
            "Be sure to talk with your financial professional about what steps may be most appropriate for your situation.\n",
            "Frequently asked questions about inflation\n",
            "What is the inflation rate?\n",
            "The inflation rate measures the change in living costs for the average consumer over a given period. While there are various measures of inflation, the one most followed is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The inflation rate for the 12 months ending June 2025 (as measured by CPI) was 2.7%. 1\n",
            "What does inflation affect?\n",
            "Changes in living costs, reflected by inflation, represent a loss of purchasing power. This is an important consideration not only in your day-to-day living, but in your long-term financial planning. To improve your quality of life over time, you’ll want to see your income grow faster than the inflation rate. To retain your lifestyle in retirement, you want to be sure that income you receive from your own investments and other sources keeps pace with changes in living costs over the course of retirement. This is why inflation has such a significant impact on individuals.\n",
            "What is a high inflation rate?\n",
            "The Federal Reserve, which is charged with maintaining stable prices, targets a long-term inflation rate of 2%. Between 2012 and 2020, the annual inflation rate was between 0.7% and 2.3%. Since that time, inflation has been much higher. It stood at 7.0% in 2021, 6.5% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023 before dropping to 2.9% in 2024. 6 Still, headline inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. 3\n",

            "\n",
            "As we step into 2024, U.S. inflation remains a significant concern for investors. With inflation currently hovering around 2.7% and historical data suggesting that higher inflation can lead to increased market volatility, understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the stock market effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### What's Driving Inflation?\n",
            "\n",
            "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports have indicated a steady increase in prices, resulting in a core inflation rate of 2.9% as of June. The fundamentals behind this uptick can be linked to various factors, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Federal Reserve Policies:** The Fed’s stance on interest rates has been critical. Currently, rates are steady with expectations for potential cuts, which could influence borrowing costs and economic growth.\n",
            "  \n",
            "- **Tariffs and Trade Policies:** Ongoing tariffs, particularly in the realm of international trade, have introduced a new layer of complexity. The effective tariff rate has surged, raising concerns about further inflation and its cascading effects on consumer prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### The Stock Market's Reaction\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, the stock market reacts to inflation in nuanced ways. Here are some key insights:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Higher Interest Rates:** Increasing rates can dampen economic growth, reduce consumer spending, and negatively impact stock prices. However, some sectors may benefit from inflation as companies can pass on costs to consumers.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Sector Performance:** Research shows that equities have outperformed inflation 90% of the time in low inflation environments (less than 3%). Sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare tend to be less affected by inflationary pressures, suggesting investors might find safer havens here.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Volatility Opportunities:** Higher inflation often leads to increased volatility in the market, which can present opportunities for short-term traders looking to capitalize on market swings.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Recommendations for Investors\n",
            "\n",
            "Investors should adopt a strategic approach during these uncertain times:\n",
            "- **Diversification:** Maintaining a well-diversified portfolio can act as a buffer against inflationary risks.\n",
            "- **Focus on Value Stocks:** Historically, value stocks outperform growth stocks during inflationary periods, making them worth considering.\n",
            "- **Stay Informed:** Keeping abreast of economic indicators, Federal Reserve announcements, and global economic conditions will be key in navigating the landscape effectively.\n",
